# Bookmark-Manager
A web site app to store url links using an SQL database
Makers Academy Week 6 project

## Objectives
We are going to build a bookmark manager, similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com in spirit. A bookmark manager is a good use case for exploring how relational databases work.

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.

The website will have the following options:

Show a list of links from the database
Add new links
Add tags to the links
Filter links by a tag
